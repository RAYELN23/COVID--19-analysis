# COVID--19-analysis
Project Documentation: COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization
Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data with a specific emphasis on India. The goal is to provide insights into epidemiological trends, vaccination coverage, healthcare infrastructure, and socio-economic indicators using Power BI.

Overview
The project is structured into several sections, each dedicated to different aspects of COVID-19 analysis and related metrics. Key sections include:

Epidemiological Metrics
Vaccination Metrics
Healthcare Infrastructure
Human Development Metrics
Each section utilizes data visualization techniques to present findings effectively.

Tools and Technologies Used
Data Analysis and Visualization: Power BI
Data Source: COVID-19 datasets with focus on India
Programming Languages: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Visualization Techniques: Charts (line, bar, pie), gauges, tables
Project Structure
1. Epidemiological Metrics
Overview: Displays total cases, recovered cases, and total deaths.
Visualizations:
Cards for key metrics (total cases, recovered cases, total deaths)
Funnel chart illustrating case progression
Line chart showing total cases over time
Bar graph depicting total deaths by year
2. Vaccination Metrics
Overview: Focuses on vaccination coverage and effectiveness.
Visualizations:
Gauge for total vaccinations, people vaccinated, and people fully vaccinated
Pie chart showing vaccination coverage across different age groups
Line graph presenting vaccination trends over time
3. Healthcare Infrastructure
Overview: Analyzes hospital beds per thousand and hand-washing facilities.
Visualizations:
Gauges for hospital beds per thousand and hand-washing facilities
Bar graph displaying hospital beds over the years
Line graph illustrating hand-washing facilities by year
4. Human Development Metrics
Overview: Examines socio-economic indicators and health factors.
Visualizations:
Cards for poverty rate, male and female smoking prevalence
Area chart for GDP per capita trends
Pie chart depicting age demographics (above 60 and above 70)
Conclusion and Recommendations
Summary of Findings: Recap key insights from each section.
Recommendations: Suggest actions based on data insights, such as improving healthcare infrastructure or targeting vaccination efforts.
